# XDsmith

**Note that this tool is still experimental and hence not fully supported.**

XDsmith is a random testing framework for the Dafny toolchain. It uses [Xsmith](https://www.flux.utah.edu/project/xsmith) to generate Dafny programs that are suitable for random testing.

See the documentation and the installation guide [here](xdsmith-doc/xdsmith.md).
